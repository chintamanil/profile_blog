      <h3>Marty Cornish</h3>
      <h5>CEO</h5>
      <p>In school when Marty looked at the sandwich his mother packed him for lunch he didn’t just see turkey on rye. He saw an opportunity. After selling his lunches throughout school, Marty continued his entrepreneurial spirit by creating his first company, Round Trip Sports. While also working as a store manager at Sherwin-Williams Paints, he worked with Oliver, who shared a passion for efficiency and over-the-top customer service. At just 27, Marty sold Round Trip Sports to focus all of his energy on building EasyPaint. Which is good news as he no longer has to sell his lunches.</p>

      <p>Oliver’s passion and hard work ethic is a daily inspiration to the entire EasyPaint team. Previously, Oliver worked in the paint industry as a Sales Representative for Sherwin-Williams Paints, where he saw first hand the need for a simpler process. There he met Marty, who not only was also able to hold his own speaking Spanish, but shared the goal of running a business someday. When not tackling the role as EasyPaint's COO, Oliver is keeping track of his finger paint crew, sons Matias and Noah.</p>
